          What Are Multiplication Tables?

            Multiplication tables are a mathematical tool that systematically show 
            the results of multiplying two numbers. They typically contain multiplications 
            from 1 to 10, but can be expanded to 100 for advanced learning.

            For example, the expression 3 × 4 = 12 is part of the multiplication table. 
            This expression means "the number 3 added 4 times" or "the number 4 added 3 times". 
            Multiplication tables allow us to perform such operations 
            quickly and practically.

            Multiplication tables are not just a calculation tool, but also a 
            learning system that helps us understand patterns and relationships between numbers. 
            Each number's multiplication table has a certain order and logic.

              Multiplication tables are a basic pedagogical tool that 
              systematically shows multiplication results, develops students' mental math skills, 
              and supports mathematical thinking.
